# CO2 Sensors
Below are some notes on the possible CO2 sensors.

## In Use

* **Sensirion SCD30**: Currently in use on the BEVO Beacon IAQ. Uses I2C to communicate the data.

## For Future Applications

* **Sensirion SCD4X**: The replacement for the SCD30, the SCD4X series has two sensors: SCD40 and SCD41.
* **Telaire T67XX**: The T67XX series has a few sensors included, the best of which is the T6713.
