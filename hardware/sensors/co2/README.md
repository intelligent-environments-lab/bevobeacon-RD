# CO2 Sensors
Below are some notes on the possible CO2 sensors.

## In Use

* **[Sensirion SCD30](https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/9.5_CO2/Sensirion_CO2_Sensors_SCD30_Datasheet.pdf)**: Currently in use on the BEVO Beacon IAQ. Uses I2C to communicate the data.

## For Future Applications

* **[Sensirion SCD4X](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensor-scd4x/)**: The replacement for the SCD30, the SCD4X series has two sensors: SCD40 and SCD41.
* **[Telaire T67XX](https://www.amphenol-sensors.com/en/telaire/co2/525-co2-sensor-modules/3399-t6713)**: The T67XX series has a few sensors included, the best of which is the T6713.
